dont-panic is a wholly remarkable script - perhaps the most remarkable,
certainly the most successful script to ever come out of the great
publishing corporations of Ursa Minor. More popular than the Celestial
Homecare Omnibus, better selling than 53 More Things to Do in
Zsh, and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid's trilogy of
philosophical blockbusters - Where Linus Went Wrong, Some More of Linus'
Greatest Mistakes, and Who is This Linus Person Anyway? It's already
supplanted the Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of all
knowledge and wisdom for two important reasons. First it's slightly
cheaper. And second, it has the words "Don't Panic" printed in large,
friendly letters on it's cover.

Don't Panic is a CLI Bash program that displays system information and also
prints the words "Don't Panic" in large, friendly letters. Useful for picking
up the girls at Starbucks that are checking out your shell over your shoulder.
